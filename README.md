<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Hangman</h3>
<p>Description: A simple, console-based game implemented in Python. A computer hides a word from you and you need to guess it, letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be hanged, if you win, you'll survive.</p>
<p>Link: https://github.com/AnaAvakimova/Hangman<p>
<p>Skills Gained:  

  
* Randomization: utilized the random module to select a word from a predefined list of words
* Control Flow: effective use of loops and conditional statements to manage the game flow, including checking for win/loss conditions and handling user input.
* User Input Handling: enhanced skills in handling user input by validating it for correctness and ensuring it meets the game's requirements.
* Sets: effectively used sets to keep track of guessed letters and ensure that duplicate guesses are handled correctly.
* Error Handling: implemented error handling to provide clear and informative messages to the user when they input invalid data.
* Menu System: designed a menu system that allows players to choose between playing the game, viewing results, and exiting the application.
* Scoring: maintained a scoring system that tracks the number of games won and lost, providing a record of the player's performance.<p>

  
<h3>Generating Randomness</h3>
<p>Description: Created a Python program that simulates a game where the computer learns patterns in user-generated sequences of 0s and 1s and attempts to predict the next sequence the user will input. The game also includes a scoring system where the user's balance increases or decreases based on the computer's prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>Skills Gained:  

  
* User Input Handling: Enhanced skills in handling user input by collecting and processing sequences of 0s and 1s provided by the user.
* String Manipulation: Demonstrated proficiency in string manipulation techniques to process and analyze user input sequences.
* Data Structures: Utilized dictionaries to store and manage data related to triads (sequences of 3 bits) and their corresponding prediction statistics.
* Conditional Statements: Implemented conditional statements to make predictions based on the statistics of observed triads.
* Looping: Employed loops to iterate through user input sequences and calculate prediction accuracy.
* Scoring System: Designed a scoring system that keeps track of the user's balance, reflecting their success in predicting user input.
* Game Logic: Implemented the game logic, including user interaction, balance updates, and the option to exit the game.<p>

  
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>Description: A simple, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python.</p>
<p>Link: https://github.com/AnaAvakimova/Simple-Tic-Tac-Toe</p>
<p>Skills Gained:  

  
* Control Flow: Implemented game logic using conditional statements and loops to manage player turns and check for win conditions.
* User Input Handling: Enhanced skills in handling user input, including validating input to ensure it represents a valid cell on the game board.
* List Manipulation: Demonstrated proficiency in manipulating lists to represent and update the game board.
* Algorithmic Thinking: Developed a win-checking algorithm that efficiently examines the game board to determine the winner.
* Error Handling: Incorporated error handling to provide informative feedback to users when they make invalid moves.
* Looping: Implemented a game loop to allow continuous play until a win, draw, or impossible game condition occurs.<p>


<h3>DutchNewsBot (in progress)</h3>
<p>Description: A program, that takes news from Dutch website, summirize it using OpenAi api, translate from dutch to russian using Deepl api and send to telegram bot.</p>
<p>Link: private/in progress </p>
<p>Skills Gained:  

  
* Telegram Bot Development: Demonstrated proficiency in creating a Telegram bot using the Telebot library for Python, allowing for interaction with users through chat messages.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designed the code using OOP principles.
* Web Scraping: Employed web scraping techniques with the BeautifulSoup library to extract links and content from a website.
* API Integration: Integrated external APIs, including OpenAI's GPT-3 and DeepL translation, to enhance the bot's functionality.
* Environmental Variables: Implemented secure handling of environmental variables for sensitive API keys, following best practices for security.
* Scheduling: Utilized the 'schedule' library to schedule tasks at specific times, automating the process of fetching and sending news updates.
* Text Summarization, Language Translation, String Manipulation, Data Structures<p>
